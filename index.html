    <meta property="og:description" content="At Finless Foods, we envision a future where fish meat for human consumption is grown outside of whole fish. We use fish stem cells harvested from living fish to produce fish meat. We plan to revolutionize the fish food industry by providing appetizing alternatives to the existing seafood products without impacting the environment. We will produce healthy fish meat which will be fresh and free of mercury, one of the major concerns with natural fish products. We envision a future where we can sustainably benefit from all the advantages of this immense nutritional source without ruining one of the Earth's most important ecosystems."/>

      <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
        <p>
          Finless Foods is an early-stage biotechnology company whose mission is to develop and mass manufacture pioneering marine animal food products for human consumption. Our objective is to create seafood sustainably using scientific cellular agriculture technologies, which will provide a cost-effective and healthier appetizing alternative to conventionally-caught and commercially-farmed seafood.        </p>
        </p>
      <h1>WHY?</h1>
        <p>
          53 percent of Earth’s fish stocks are fully exploited, but consumption of fish continues to increase. Our hauls of fish will be smaller and smaller as the years go by, and governments will continue limiting fishing in order to protect our ocean ecosystems. This scarcity of fish meat means that the price of fish will stay on its rising course, putting healthy fish protein out of reach for all but the richest of consumers. The pollution of the ocean also allows for heavy metals like mercury to accumulate in fish, limiting the recommended consumption amounts of this otherwise nutritious and healthy source of energy.        </p>
        <p>
          Fishing is killing our planet. Our ocean ecosystems can’t take the strain of increased fish production, and fish consumption is in a steady rise. Money is being poured into creating efficient aquaculture systems, to grow fish in tanks on land for human consumption. While this is a move in the right direction, if we’re going to make this system as efficient as possible we need to rethink things from the bottom up. Aquaculture is a system of inputs and outputs, why would we have our expensive food inputs create energy for the fish only to have that energy diverted into things we don’t need, like swimming or having a heartbeat? Why can’t we have a system that only puts energy into growing the parts that people want?
        </p>
      <h1>OUR SOLUTION</h1>
        <p>
          By using a combination of well-established and cutting-edge cell culture techniques, a small sample of cells from a living marine animal will be cultured and structured in a brewery-like environment in the same shape as a fish fillet. We will then design a cheap and efficient growth media for this cell line that will allow our cells to grow quickly. Once we have this, we will lay the cells out on a structure that will shape them to both look and have the texture of real fish meat, because it will be - on a cellular level - real fish meat.  </p>
